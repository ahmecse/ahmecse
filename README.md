## About Me

I hold an M.Tech in Data Science from IIT Madras (2024) and a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT (2022). My professional experience includes working as a Project Associate at the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBCDSAI), IIT Madras, where I was guided by Prof. B. Ravindran.

My research is centered on reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on its application to large language models (LLMs). My current focus is specifically on Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models (RL for LLMs).

I am keen on collaborating on projects involving RL, LLMs, Causality, and Multi-Agent Systems. My core expertise lies in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Reinforcement Learning.

## Past Projects

My project portfolio spans several key areas within AI and computer science, demonstrating practical application and research exploration.

In **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, I have completed comprehensive coursework assignments from IITM (CS6700), implementing algorithms such as SARSA, Q-Learning, Hierarchical RL using SMDP & Intra-Option Q-Learning, Dueling DQN, and REINFORCE. These implementations involved comparisons in Grid World variants, training advanced DQN models, and applying hierarchical techniques in environments like Taxi-v3. You can find details in the respective repositories for [Assignment 1](https://github.com/ahmecse/RL-Assignments-1-IITM-CS6700), [Assignment 2](https://github.com/ahmecse/RL-Assignments-2-IITM-CS6700), and [Assignment 3](https://github.com/ahmecse/RL-Assignments-3-IITM-CS6700). Beyond coursework, I developed the [RL4LLM Framework](https://github.com/ahmecse/RL4LLM), a toolkit specifically designed for fine-tuning Large Language Models using RL. Additionally, I maintain the [RL-Research Suite](https://github.com/ahmecse/rl-research), a collection of benchmark RL environments and algorithms aimed at facilitating research.

Within **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, my work includes the [NLP Information Retrieval System](https://github.com/ahmecse/CS6370-NLP-IR-System-Project-IITM), a project undertaken during my studies at IITM (CS6370) focused on building an effective IR system. I have also explored the intersection of causality and NLP through the [Causal-NLP](https://github.com/ahmecse/causal-nlp) project, developing causal inference tools tailored for NLP tasks.

My engagement with core **Machine Learning (ML)** concepts is demonstrated through a series of mathematical essays that delve into the theoretical underpinnings of fundamental machine learning models. These essays cover [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/ahmecse/A-Mathematical-Essay-on-Support-Vector-Machine), [Random Forests](https://github.com/ahmecse/A-Mathematical-essay-on-Random-Forest), [Decision Trees](https://github.com/ahmecse/A-Mathematical-essay-on-decision-trees), [Naive Bayes Classifiers](https://github.com/ahmecse/Mathematical-essay-on-naive-Bayes-classifier), [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/ahmecse/Mathematical-essay-on-Logistic-Regression), and [Linear Regression](https://github.com/ahmecse/A-Mathematical-essay-on-linear-regression). On the practical side, I applied advanced regression techniques in the [Advanced Regression - House Prices](https://github.com/ahmecse/Advanced-Regression-for-House-Price-Prediction) project to tackle the challenge of house price prediction.

In the domain of **Deep Learning (DL)**, my IITM coursework (CS6910) involved hands-on assignments. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/ahmecse/DL-Assignments-1-IITM-CS6910) required implementing a feedforward neural network from scratch, complete with various optimizers and hyperparameter tuning. For [Assignment 2](https://github.com/ahmecse/DL-Assignments-2-IITM-CS6910), I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from the ground up, optimized its hyperparameters, and explored model interpretability methods. [Assignment 3](https://github.com/ahmecse/DL-Assignments-3-IITM-CS6910) focused on sequence-to-sequence modeling, where I developed RNN, LSTM, and GRU models incorporating attention mechanisms for the task of English-to-Malayalam transliteration.

My work in **Computer Vision (CV)** includes my Bachelor's thesis, [COVID-19 CXR Classification](https://github.com/ahmecse/BSc-Thesis-COVID19-CXR-TransferLearning), which utilized Transfer Learning techniques for classifying COVID-19 based on Chest X-Ray images. I have also worked extensively with YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for object detection. One project involved [Finding Cars from Aerial Images](https://github.com/ahmecse/Find-Cars-from-Aerial-Images-Using-YOLO-NAS-YOLOV8) using both YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8. Another applied [YOLOv8 for detection, segmentation, and classification on custom datasets](https://github.com/ahmecse/Ultralytics-YOLOv8-Object-Detection-Model---Detection-Segmentation-and-Classification-on-Custom-Data). Further projects include [GreenVine](https://github.com/ahmecse/GreenVine-Early-Plant-Disease-Detection), aimed at early plant disease detection, and a [Digit Recogniser](https://github.com/ahmecse/Digit-recogniser-computer-vision-) for identifying handwritten digits.
